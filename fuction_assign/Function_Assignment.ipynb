    "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    "Ans) \n",
    "Function\tMethod\n",
    "A standalone block of code that can be called from anywhere in the code. It is not associated with any object.\tA function that is associated with an object and is called on an instance of a class. It can access and modify the object's attributes.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "def greet(name):  # Function\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):  # Method\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n",
    "print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # Calls the function\n",
    "person = Person(\"Bob\")\n",
    "print(person.greet())  # Calls the method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "Ans)\n",
    "Parameters: Variables defined in the function signature that accept values when the function is called.\n",
    "Arguments: The actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "def add(a, b):  # a and b are parameters\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)  # 5 and 3 are arguments\n",
    "print(result)  # Outputs: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "Ans) Functions can be defined using the def keyword, as lambda functions, or within classes (methods).\n",
    "Standard Function:\n",
    "def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "    return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "print(multiply(4, 5))  # Outputs: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda Function:\n",
    "square = lambda x: x ** 2\n",
    "print(square(4))  # Outputs: 16\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in a Python function?\n",
    "Ans) The return statement is used to exit a function and optionally send a value back to the caller. If no return statement is specified, the function returns None by default.\n",
    "def square(num):\n",
    "    return num ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = square(3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Outputs: 9\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "Ans) Iterable: An object that can return an iterator. It implements the __iter__() or __getitem__() method.\n",
    "Iterator: An object that implements the __iter__() and __next__() methods, allowing iteration over the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "iterator = iter(my_list)  # Create an iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Outputs: 1\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Outputs: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# my_list is iterable; iterator is an iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "Ans) Generators are a special type of iterator that yield values one at a time and maintain their state between calls. They are defined using functions with the yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "def countdown(n):\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        yield n\n",
    "        n -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in countdown(5):\n",
    "    print(number)  # Outputs: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "Ans) Memory Efficiency: Generators produce items one at a time, thus using less memory than storing an entire list.\n",
    "Lazy Evaluation: They only compute values as needed, which can lead to performance improvements in large datasets.\n",
    "def generate_numbers(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        yield i * i\n",
    "\n",
    "# This will only compute values as needed\n",
    "for num in generate_numbers(10):\n",
    "    print(num)  # Outputs squares of numbers from 0 to 9\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "Ans) A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but has a single expression.\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "print(add(3, 5))  # Outputs: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
    "Ans)  The map() function applies a specified function to every item in an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which is an iterator).\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter() functions in Python?\n",
    "Ans) map(): Applies a function to every item in an iterable and returns an iterator of results.\n",
    "reduce(): Applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in an iterable (requires importing functools).\n",
    "filter(): Filters items from an iterable based on a function that returns True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# map()\n",

    "summed = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)  # 15\n",
    "\n",

    "evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))  # [2, 4]\n",
    "\n",

    "print(\"Summed:\", summed)\n",
    "print(\"Evens:\", evens)\n",
